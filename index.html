      <h3> Hi, I am Abhi!</h2>
      <p class="intro"> I like building websites and meeting new people. I am from Chennai, India and I moved to Amsterdam a year ago. I helped a friend  that started a business in Amsterdam for mentoring expats called Expats Landing Pad and also helped my dutch teacher with her website. I used WIX editor which has drag and drop functionality to build websites and liked designing the website and felt that I really wanted to be doing this. My journey to be a front-end developer started when I got some interests in building websites and then I started implementing the templates from themeforest into websites, I started learning about the different aspects of website development like user validation, forms requests, handling user interactions etc. but I couldn't pursue it as a career. So when I found that the Codaisseur web developement program has a real-time project based bootcamp working with business oriented model I decided to go for it.</p>
